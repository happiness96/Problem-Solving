## 문제
You are to write a program to compute different sums based on the given positive integer N.

## 입력
The first line of the input includes the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000. Each test case appears in one line containing 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000.

## 출력
For each test case, print three space separated integers S1, S2, S3 in one line where

S1 : the sum of first N positive integer,
S2 : the sum of first N positive odd integer,
S3 : the sum of first N positive even integer.
