## 문제
We say that a string is odd if and only if all palindromic substrings of the string have odd length.

Given a string s, determine if it is odd or not.

A substring of a string s is a nonempty sequence of consecutive characters from s. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## 입력
The input consists of a single line containing the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100).

It is guaranteed that s consists of lowercase ASCII letters (‘a’–‘z’) only

## 출력
If s is odd, then print “Odd.” on a single line (without quotation marks). Otherwise, print “Or not.” on a single line (without quotation marks).
