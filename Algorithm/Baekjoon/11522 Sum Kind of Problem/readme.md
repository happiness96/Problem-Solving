## 문제
For this problem you will compute various running sums of values for positive integers.

## 입력
The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 10000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently.

Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by an integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000).

## 출력
For each data set there is one line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a single space followed by three space separated integers S1, S2 and S3 such that:

S1 = The sum of the first N positive integers.

S2 = The sum of the first N odd integers.

S3 = The sum of the first N even integers.
